        <p style="font-size: larger;" style="margin:0 5% 0 0;">The 2000-year old fort has been the site of many
            battles, with the Battle of Sinhagad (1670) being the most notable of
            all. The fort was named ‘Lion Fort’ (Sinhagad) to honor the sacrifice
            of Tanaji Malusare (right hand of
            Chhatrapati
            Shivaji) who lost his life while fighting the Mughals in the battle.
            The fort, built on the top of a hill,
            offers an
            amazing view of the lush greenery surrounding it.
            Pune Darwaza and Kalyan Darwaza are the two entrances to
            the fort,
            with the former being the main entry point for visitors.
            There are a few temples and a memorial built for
            Tanaji
            Malusare inside the fort. Click here to know places to visit with 100km

        <p style="font-size: larger;"> Although there is a motorable road till the entrance, trekking to it is
            preferred
            by many youngsters. The
            13-km trek has
            a medium difficulty level which makes it one of the best forts near Pune for trekking.</p>
