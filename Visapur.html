        <p style="font-size: larger;" style="margin:0 5% 0 0;">Visapur Fort is located near Visapur village of
            Maharashtra, India.
            It was built as a twin fort to Lohagad fort but the
            only difference is that Visapur fort is at slight higher height (3556 feet) than the Lohagad fort. Lohagad
            fort is built
            at the vicinity of 10 km distance.

            Lohagad was built earlier than Visapur fort. Visapur fort was built by Balaji Vishwanath, the first Peshwa
            to
            Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj. It is said that it was in use between 1713-1818. Fort was built with the help of
            stones.

            We can say that even though they used stones to construct these forts but then also they proved to be most
            trustworthy
            and strong enough too!

            This fort has Hanuman carvings that show the patron deity of the empire at that era. But unfortunately,
            demolished in
            1818. At those times these forts and nearby villages invaded by the enemies so as to extend their empire.




        <p style="font-size: larger;">The Visapur fort was built with the purpose to protect the Lohagad fort. The
            Lohagad fort was ruled by various dynasties
            like Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavs, Bahmanis, Nizams, Mughals and Marathas.

            Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured The Lohagad fort in 1648AD. But soon as per the Treaty of Purandar he
            had to give it
            to the Mughals. But Shivaji Maharaj again recaptured it in 1665 AD. And afterwards, it was used to keep the
            treasury.
            For a long time, the Marathas ruled it.</p>

        <p>Visapur Fort Height is about 3567 feet. Distance from Pune to Visapur Fort base is 65 km approx & driving
            time is 90
            mins.</p>
