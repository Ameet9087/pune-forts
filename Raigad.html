        <p style="font-size: larger;">Raigad Fort is another witness to the glorious past of the Maratha empire, be it
            the coronation of
            Chhatrapati Shivaji
            or the various battles that were fought here. The hill fortress was the capital of the Maratha empire during
            the reign
            of Chhatrapati Shivaji. Though many portions of the fort are in ruins, the remaining structures stand tall,
            testifying
            why Raigad Fort was called the ‘King of Forts’ as well as ‘Gibraltar of the East. There are towers, grand
            entrances,
            artificial lakes, a Shiva temple and many other structures inside the fort.

        <p style="font-size: larger;">Raigad Fort is a favorite among adventure enthusiasts because you have to either
            use the ropeway or trek to
            the fort,
            which is 2700 feet above sea level. Those who want to trek to the fort need to climb around 1700 steps from
            the
            foothills to reach the fort.</p>
