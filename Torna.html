        <p style="font-size: larger;" style="margin:0 5% 0 0;">The historical significance of Torna Fort is that it was
            the first fort captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj;
            thereby, making it the foundation of the Maratha empire. With an elevation of over 4600 feet above sea
            level, it is also
            the highest fort near Pune. Over the years, it has become one of the favorite destinations for anyone who
            wishes to
            experience history amidst the opulence of natural beauty.












        <p style="font-size: larger;">Torna Fort is also a popular trekking hotspot, and the best time to visit it is
            between September and December. The trek
            begins from Velhe village as its base. One will first get the exalted view of the fort in the distance after
            a walk of
            200 m. The entire trail is dotted with rocky patches hemmed by dense vegetation. The 4-hour trek goes
            through various
            structures like Bini Darwaza, Menghai Goddess Temple, Budhla Machi and the majestic Zunjar Machi. If you are
            trekking to
            the fort during the monsoon, be a little careful as the trail becomes slippery in patches.</p>
