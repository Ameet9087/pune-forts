        <p style="font-size: larger;" style="margin:0 5% 0 0;">Harishchandragad is a historical hill fort situated in
            Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra.
            The height of the fort is
            1,424 meters.. Harishchandragad is very popular place for trekking in Maharashtra and also one of the famous
            Bhandardara
            tourist places.

            The fort originally dates back to the 6th century during the rule of Kalchuri dynasty. The citadel was built
            during this
            era and various caves probably have been carved out in the 11th century AD. Sage Changdev used to meditate
            here in 14th
            century AD. Later the fort was under the control of Mughals and Marathas captured it in 1747 AD. Remnants of
            Microlithic
            human inhabitants have been discovered here. The various Puranas like Matsyapurana, Agnipurana and
            Skandapurana have
