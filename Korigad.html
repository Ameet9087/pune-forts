        <p style="font-size: larger;" style="margin:0 5% 0 0;">Korigad Fort, which is around 3028 feet above sea level,
            is one of the highest forts in India, making it a popular
            trekking destination among youngsters. The fort was unknown for long until Shivaji Maharaj incorporated it
            into his
            kingdom in 1657. The fort remained under the Maratha empire before getting captured by the British in 1818.

            There is a temple dedicated to a local deity, Korai Devi, and many other small temples dedicated to Lord
            Vishnu and Lord
            Shiva inside the fort. The 2-km defensive wall is the main highlight of the fort. It is completely intact,
            and you can
            walk along its perimeter. Besides these and several other structures, there are six cannons inside the fort,
            with Laxmi
            Toph being the largest of all.


        <p style="font-size: larger;">As there’s no motorable road to the fort, you need to park your vehicle at the
            parking provided near the bus stop in
            Peth Shahpur village. From here you need to trek to the top. As it’s an easy climb, even beginners can
            undertake the
            hike without difficulty. If you want to enjoy the mesmerizing view of the surroundings, we recommend taking
            a day trek
            to the fort during summer. If you wish to stay overnight, there are many camping sites on the fort,
            including Korai Devi
            Temple that can accommodate around 25 people.</p>
