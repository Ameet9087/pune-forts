        <p style="font-size: larger;" style="margin:0 5% 0 0;">Dating back to the 17th century, Shivneri Fort was the
            birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the
            Maratha empire. Located near Junnar town, the military fortification has a memorial of Shivaji, known as
            Shiv Kunj right
            in the center. The fort offers a panoramic view of the picturesque mountainous and beautiful lakes in the
            backdrop.




        <p style="font-size: larger;"> The fort has been rightly rated as one of the most favorite places for
            sightseeing as it has some interesting spots,
            such as the temple of Goddess Shivai.</p>
